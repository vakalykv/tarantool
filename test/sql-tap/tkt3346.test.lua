-- Ticket #3530
--
-- As shown by ticket #3346 above (see also ticket #3298) it is important
-- that a subquery in the result-set be able to look up through multiple
-- FROM levels in order to view tables in the FROM clause at the top level.
--
-- But ticket #3530 shows us that a subquery in the FROM clause should not
-- be able to look up to higher levels:
