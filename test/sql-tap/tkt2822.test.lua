-- The ORDER BY matching algorithm is three steps:
-- 
--   (1)  If the ORDER BY term is an integer constant i, then
--        sort by the i-th column of the result set.
-- 
--   (2)  If the ORDER BY term is an identifier (not x.y or x.y.z
--        but simply x) then look for a column alias with the same
--        name.  If found, then sort by that column.
-- 
--   (3)  Evaluate the term as an expression and sort by the
--        value of the expression.
-- 
-- For a compound SELECT the rules are modified slightly.
-- In the third rule, the expression must exactly match one
-- of the result columns.  The sequences of three rules is
-- attempted first on the left-most SELECT.  If that doesn't
-- work, we move to the right, one by one.
--
-- Rule (3) is not in standard SQL - it is an sql extension,
-- though one copied from PostgreSQL.  The rule for compound
-- queries where a search is made of SELECTs to the right
-- if the left-most SELECT does not match is not a part of
-- standard SQL either.  This extension is unique to sql
-- as far as we know.
--
-- Rule (2) was added by the changes ticket #2822.  Prior to
-- that changes, sql did not support rule (2), making it
-- technically in violation of standard SQL semantics.  
-- No body noticed because rule (3) has the same effect as
-- rule (2) except in some obscure cases.
--
-- Test plan:
--
--   tkt2822-1.* - Simple identifier as ORDER BY expression.
--   tkt2822-2.* - More complex ORDER BY expressions.
