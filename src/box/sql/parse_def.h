/**
 * This file contains auxiliary structures and functions which
 * are used only during parsing routine (see parse.y).
 * Their main purpose is to assemble common parts of altered
 * entities (such as name, or IF EXISTS clause) and pass them
 * as a one object to further functions.
 *
 * Hierarchy is following:
 *
 * Base structure is ALTER.
 * ALTER is omitted only for CREATE TABLE since table is filled
 * with meta-information just-in-time of parsing:
 * for instance, as soon as field's name and type are recognized
 * they are added to space definition.
 *
 * DROP is general for all existing objects and includes
 * name of object itself, name of parent object (table),
 * IF EXISTS clause and may contain on-drop behaviour
 * (CASCADE/RESTRICT, but now it is always RESTRICT).
 * Hence, it terms of grammar - it is a terminal symbol.
 *
 * RENAME can be applied only to table (at least now, since it is
 * ANSI extension), so it is also terminal symbol.
 *
 * CREATE in turn can be expanded to nonterminal symbol
 * CREATE CONSTRAINT or to terminal CREATE TABLE/INDEX/TRIGGER.
 * CREATE CONSTRAINT unfolds to FOREIGN KEY or UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY.
 *
 * For instance:
 * ALTER TABLE t ADD CONSTRAINT c FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES t2(id);
 * ALTER *TABLE* -> CREATE ENTITY -> CREATE CONSTRAINT -> CREATE FK
 *
 * CREATE TRIGGER tr1 ...
 * ALTER *TABLE* -> CREATE ENTITY -> CREATE TRIGGER
