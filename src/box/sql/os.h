 * Temporary files are named starting with this prefix followed by 16 random
 * alphanumeric characters, and no file extension. They are stored in the
 * OS's standard temporary file directory, and are deleted prior to exit.
 * If sql is being embedded in another program, you may wish to change the
 * prefix to reflect your program's name, so that if your program exits
 * prematurely, old temporary files can be easily identified. This can be done
 * using -DSQL_TEMP_FILE_PREFIX=myprefix_ on the compiler command line.
 *
 * 2006-10-31:  The default prefix used to be "sql_".  But then
 * Mcafee started using sql in their anti-virus product and it
 * started putting files with the "sql" name in the c:/temp folder.
 * This annoyed many windows users.  Those users would then do a
 * Google search for "sql", find the telephone numbers of the
 * developers and call to wake them up at night and complain.
 * For this reason, the default name prefix is changed to be "sql"
 * spelled backwards.  So the temp files are still identified, but
 * anybody smart enough to figure out the code is also likely smart
 * enough to know that calling the developer will not help get rid
 * of the file.

 * PENDING:   A single process may hold a PENDING lock on a file at
 *            any one time. Existing SHARED locks may persist, but no new
 *            SHARED locks may be obtained by other processes.
 * EXCLUSIVE: An EXCLUSIVE lock precludes all other locks.

 * PENDING_LOCK A process that requests an EXCLUSIVE lock may

/*
 * File Locking Notes:
 *
 *
 * LockFile() prevents not just writing but also reading by other processes.
 * A SHARED_LOCK is obtained by locking a single randomly-chosen
 * byte out of a specific range of bytes. The lock byte is obtained at
 * random so two separate readers can probably access the file at the
 * same time, unless they are unlucky and choose the same lock byte.
 * An EXCLUSIVE_LOCK is obtained by locking all bytes in the range.
 * There can only be one writer.  A RESERVED_LOCK is obtained by locking
 * a single byte of the file that is designated as the reserved lock byte.
 * A PENDING_LOCK is obtained by locking a designated byte different from
 * the RESERVED_LOCK byte.
 *
 * The following #defines specify the range of bytes used for locking.
 * SHARED_SIZE is the number of bytes available in the pool from which
 * a random byte is selected for a shared lock.  The pool of bytes for
 * shared locks begins at SHARED_FIRST.
 *
 * Changing the value of PENDING_BYTE results in a subtly incompatible
 * file format.  Depending on how it is changed, you might not notice
 * the incompatibility right away, even running a full regression test.
 * The default location of PENDING_BYTE is the first byte past the
 * 1GB boundary.
